This is a website initially set up for a lab demo. It is no longer needed but still hosted for the occasional time it becomes useful. The website allows a user to download the EICAR standard antivirus test file directly from a website. This has uses for penetration testing and antivirus testing without putting a system at risk. 

About the EICAR Test File

The EICAR file is an industry-standard, harmless test string used to verify that antivirus systems are functioning correctly. It poses no real threat to systems, but it is intentionally designed to trigger antivirus alerts.

NOTE: THIS WILL TRIGGER ANTIVIRUS! ONLY USE THIS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
